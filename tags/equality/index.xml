      <description>Lately I implemented my own immutable Queue and came upon a problem implementing equality for it. The problem goes like this: You want a generic data-type that supports equality. But it only should support equality if the generic type also supports equality.
Seems a little bit weird? But this is actually a common problem in F# that is already solved without that you probably even noticed that this is a problem.</description>
