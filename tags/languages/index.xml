      <description>In the past I have worked a lot in web-development. This goes back to the early 2000 when web-sites was primarily just CGI scripts and didn&amp;rsquo;t used any JavaScript at all. Back then JavaScript also was mostly very slow as most Browser interpreted JavaScript.&#xA;Back in that old times every click on a button, link and so on was a full request to the browser and a full new page has to be generated on the server side.</description>
