      <description>What Is Recently I implemented my own data-structure to optimize the storage of my components in a game. Okay its more an architecture i am exploring not a real game at the moment. I just try to render and move as many things as possible while i try to keep frames per second as high as possible.&#xA;For example rendering 10,000 boxes let them move in random directions, and change direction every second to a new random direction runs at 600 fps.</description>
