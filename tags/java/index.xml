      <description>Here is some knowledge that i gathered how Java&amp;rsquo;s typing system works. Don&amp;rsquo;t know which version. But it&amp;rsquo;s an older one. Somwhere around Java 6 to Java 8. Maybe it changed now.&#xA;Consider that generics was added to Java, and it was not a default of the language. When Java would have started with Generics, it might have evolved different.&#xA;So a common problem you have is storing data in an Array.</description>
