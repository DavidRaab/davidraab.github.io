      <description>The most general function to traverse a data-structures is the fold function. But fold has one problem that is sometimes not optimal. It always traverses the whole data-structure and we cannot abort the recusion early.
But sometimes, that is exactly what we want to do. For example when we want to search for a specific element in a list, when we found it, we don&amp;rsquo;t want to go through the remaing list.</description>

      <description>In From mutable loops to immutable folds we implemented foldBack through rev and fold. In this post I show you how you can implement foldBack by using a continuation function.
Functions Before we see how to implement foldBack, I want to give you analogy first. This analogy helped me in a lot of cases. I hope that this analogy will also help you in better understanding the further post, or probably even in other areas in programming in general.</description>

      <description>When we ask of key-features of functional programming, you will probably hear two things most often. Immutability and recursion. But why is that so? As Immutability also becomes more important in OO languages you will probably find a lot of reason for that one, but why are recursive functions so important? The short answer is, because of Immutability! To understand the connection between those, let&amp;rsquo;s start with some code that uses loops with mutation.</description>
