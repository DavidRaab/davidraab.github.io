      <description>I already wrote an article that explains immutability, but one thing I hand-waved was the benefits of immutability and why you should program with immutable values.&#xA;In this article I talk about those benefits by trying to maintaining valid objects at all time and show how we can achieve it with mutability and immutability.&#xA;One question might be why I&amp;rsquo;m not just showing the immutable part. I could do this, but the problem I see is that it isn&amp;rsquo;t so obvious how hard the mutable part really is.</description>
