      <description>Today every Linux system mostly already ships Perl including a lot of modules. While this can be totally fine sometimes maybe you want to switch to a newer Perl version. Or maybe even an older version to test a module with an older Perl version for compatibility?
perlbrew is a tool that helps installing multiple Perl environments and gives you the ability to switch between them. Installing your own Perl also means you don&amp;rsquo;t mess with the system installed Perl and you are able to install any new module directly from CPAN.</description>
