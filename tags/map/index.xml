      <description>When I started Perl programming back around 2003 one thing that perl had, what most language didn&amp;rsquo;t, already was the existence of the map function.&#xA;In today world of programming from JavaScript, C#, Java and so on, the concept nowadays is so common that nearly every language has it, and usually every programmers understands and use it.&#xA;That was not always the case. I can remember when LINQ was introduced in C# how a lot of people complaining how from know on C# would be a language that nobody else never can read or understand anymore.</description>
