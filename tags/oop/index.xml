      <description>Let&amp;rsquo;s do object-oriented programming in C. First of I am creating an easy example for an Vector2 type. To define a Vector2 in C we use a struct.
1 2 3 4 struct Vector2 { int X; int Y; }; When you know C#, you are already familiar with a struct. A struct is a value-type in C. It always gets copied as a whole. In C# we have a class that is a reference-type but this doesn&amp;rsquo;t exist in C.</description>

      <description>One important concept in functional programming is immutability. But also in object-oriented programming immutability and so called immutable objects getting more attention. The problem that I see especially from object-oriented programmers are really bad explanations. A lot of explanation I had see described it like this: Just create a class and make all fields readonly (final or const) and you have an immutable object.
Explanations like these are horrible. Such explanations are so simplified that I would even call them wrong.</description>
