      <description>map operates on functions not on data-types like list.&#xA;When I started learning F# I had some problems understanding the map function. Don&amp;rsquo;t get me wrong. As a Perl programmer map is built into the core language (long before other languages adopted the idea) and I used and understanded it very well in Perl. This map is the same as List.map that I also immediately understood.&#xA;But in F# you will encounter Result.</description>

      <title>Optional Generic Equality on a Data-Type in F#</title>

      <description>Lately I implemented my own immutable Queue and came upon a problem implementing equality for it. The problem goes like this: You want a generic data-type that supports equality. But it only should support equality if the generic type also supports equality.&#xA;Seems a little bit weird? But this is actually a common problem in F# that is already solved without that you probably even noticed that this is a problem.</description>
