      <description>One important function in functional programming is the map function. When I learned F# I must admit that I had some problems first, understanding it. The problem was, I already knew the map function from dozens of other languages. Or to say it correctly, I mostly learned a wrong explanation of map.
The typical explanation I&amp;rsquo;m talking about often goes something like this: map takes a function and a list. It applies the function to every element in the list, and returns a new list.</description>

      <description>In my previous post about Structured Programming I talked about that basic looping constructs fold. But this is still to powerful. In the sense of readability we should try to eliminate them with more specific ones. In this post I go through a toy example to show the various ways on how to refactor some code.
The Toy Example Recently I had some conversation about code in a game and providing some kind of critical hit-chance in a game.</description>
