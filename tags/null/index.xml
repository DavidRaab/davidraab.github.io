      <description>In this post I want to talk about Optionals more deeply. I already wrote about null, but I noticed that it is still not immediately clear on why Optionals are better.

      <description>Tony Hoare once said: I call it my billion-dollar mistake. It was the invention of the null reference in 1965. So, why did he added &amp;ldquo;null&amp;rdquo; in the first place? Why was it such a big mistake. And if it is such a big mistake, what are the alternatives?&#xA;The purpose of null To understand why it was a mistake, let&amp;rsquo;s look why it was even added in the first place.</description>
