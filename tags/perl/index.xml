      <description>Today every Linux system mostly already ships Perl including a lot of modules. While this can be totally fine sometimes maybe you want to switch to a newer Perl version. Or maybe even an older version to test a module with an older Perl version for compatibility?
perlbrew is a tool that helps installing multiple Perl environments and gives you the ability to switch between them. Installing your own Perl also means you don&amp;rsquo;t mess with the system installed Perl and you are able to install any new module directly from CPAN.</description>

      <description>Today, more and more languages supports functions as first-class values. This means a function is just a value like any other. You can pass functions as arguments to functions, but you are also able to create functions and return them from functions.
Whenever this is done we have to think about the life-time of variables. Usually all variables are lexical scoped. Consider the following example.
F# C# Perl JavaScript Racket 1 2 3 let add10 y = let x = 10 x + y 1 2 3 4 public static int Add10(int y) { var x = 10; return x + y; } 1 2 3 4 sub add10($y) { my $x = 10; return $x + $y; } 1 2 3 4 function add10(y) { const x = 10; return x + y; } 1 2 3 4 (define (add10 y) (define x 10) (+ x y) ) In the example the variable x is created only temporary when the function is being executed.</description>

      <title>Perl Regex Parsing with the g option</title>

      <description>Perl regexes have the /g modifier that is worth knowing about, as you can do a lot of advanced things with this modifier. But here are the basics first.
Context First we need to understand that Perl has two different contexts and in both contexts the /g modifier works differently.
List context Let&amp;rsquo;s see list context first. We can enforce list context by assigning to an array.
Without the /g option a regex just finds its first match and just returns it.</description>
