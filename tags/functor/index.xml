      <description>One problem that appears from time to time is that we we have some kind of collection (I use list here) and we want to map every element with a monadic function &#39;a -&amp;gt; M&amp;lt;&#39;b&amp;gt;. This then returns a list&amp;lt;M&amp;lt;&#39;a&amp;gt;&amp;gt;. But often we want a M&amp;lt;list&amp;lt;&#39;a&amp;gt;&amp;gt;.
To be more concrete. Let&amp;rsquo;s assume we want to turn a list of strings into integers. We could write a tryParseInt function that does string -&amp;gt; option&amp;lt;int&amp;gt;.</description>

      <description>In Understanding map we learned that implementing a map function is what we call a Functor. In Applicative Functors we extended that idea with the return and apply function and we call the result an Applicative Functor. The next important function in our toolset is the bind function.
Monads The combination of return and bind is what we call a Monad. But currently I will not consider this as an introduction to Monads at all.</description>

      <description>In my previous article Understanding map I introduced the map function and described that implementing map and fulfilling two laws we get what we call a Functor. In this Post we discuss the apply function that we can view as an extension to the map function.
Problem with map It might be that you have noticed one problem with map. map only can work with one-argument functions! The definition of map expects a function &#39;a -&amp;gt; &#39;b as it&amp;rsquo;s first argument.</description>

      <description>One important function in functional programming is the map function. When I learned F# I must admit that I had some problems first, understanding it. The problem was, I already knew the map function from dozens of other languages. Or to say it correctly, I mostly learned a wrong explanation of map.
The typical explanation I&amp;rsquo;m talking about often goes something like this: map takes a function and a list. It applies the function to every element in the list, and returns a new list.</description>
